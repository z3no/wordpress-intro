# A WordPress Introduction
***

Learning some 'user side' of WordPress on me B-DAY! Let's check it out.

## Me B-DAY mission
***

- [ ] Go to the WordPress official website and register.
- [ ] Click on the "start your website" button
- [ ] Choose a domain name for your website, then select the free option
- [ ] Don't worry, you don't have to pay. Click the obscurely hidden "start with a free site" link.
- Let's start building!
- [ ] Choose a theme if you want to do this on easy mode, use a blank canvas if you want more of a challenge!
  - Some themes will have a blog-like homepage. The content on this page will be generated based on which posts you make.
  - This makes it pretty limited as to how we're able to customise our homepage.
  - This will also change some features in you UI, like the "edit" feature on your homepage.
  - You will be able to make changes to your homepage, but way more limited than on "regular" pages.
  - If you want to change your theme to a different one, click on "My Home" in the menu and next "Change theme".
- [ ] There's a couple steps WordPress gives you in the "Site setup" menu, complete them.
  - Pay attention to their explanations, their tutorials help you understand how to interact with their UI
  - If you want to skip all tutorials, that's fine too, it should be manageable to understand.
  - If you skip the tutorials and things are not clear, you might want to revisit the tutorials.
- [ ] When done following the steps, you can launch your website.
  - Again, you don't need to pay. Scroll to the bottom of the page for your free option.
  - While choosing the plan, you also do not need to pay.
- [ ] Now make a repository, add a README and put the link to your website in there.
- [ ] Let's have a look at our pages, click on the "Pages" tab in the menu
  - You now get an overview of your Published, Drafted, Scheduled and Trashed pages.
  - Remove all unwanted pages, only regular pages can be trashed, so make the ones you want to trash all regular pages.
  - Add at least one page, you can choose a theme again or use a blank page!
  - This takes you to the page editor of WordPress.
  - Save this draft for now.
- [ ] A couple of things to know about this edit view:
  - If you want to go back to the home view, the top right WordPress logo is the place to go. Click "view pages" and you're back where you were.
  - You can click on any element in the page and edit it directly
  - The plus button in the toolbar opens up the block inserter, this is to add new elements to your page.
  - If you want a nice overview of all elements on your page, click on the list view in the toolbar
  - To the right of the toolbar, you can open up the settings. These show you the settings of the page you're on or the block you select.
  - Next to the settings you can change the fonts and global styles
  - The button with the 3 dots is the option button. Right now you can see we are in the visual editor, but if you want to write code you can also open the code editor.
- [ ] Let's add some things! Open up the block inserter
  - You can see a lot of categories, each containing elements you can add to your page
  - From each category, pick at least 1 of the blocks to add to this page, or any other page you make. (Except for the earn category)
  - If you can't find one in the category that does not require a premium account, skip the category.
  - Make sure to customise every block, you can use dummy / fake text but don't leave anything empty that shouldn't be.
- [ ] Let's get hacky! Open up the code editor
  - In the code, add a div and put some text in it at the top.
  - Above that, add a style tag and customise the div to have a background color.
  - WordPress doesn't like you doing that, so some wonky stuff might happen
  - There is a way to overcome this, the end result will be your div with a background color
- [ ] Let's customise our theme! Go back to the home view of your website and click on "appearance" in the left toolbar
  - Now we can customise our selected theme or change it! Go ahead and click on "customise"
  - In here we can change stuff like colors, menus and so on.
  - Adding additional css is a premium feature, however in the previous step we have learned to overcome this with our developer knowledge! Nice try WordPress!
  - WordPress does their best though to make our life a living hell when we try to change something through css, so not everything will work.
- [ ] Remember how to customise your fonts? Go ahead and pick one to your liking, don't leave it at the default font!
- [ ] Last step, add a contact form anywhere on your pages.
- [ ] Done! Go have a look at the nice to have features, or just have some fun with WordPress!

## B-DAY Must-haves
***

- At least 2 pages.
  - Both have a custom background color, not the original one! (It can be the same color on both pages).
  - Change the footer credit. Optionally try hiding it anyway!
- At least 1 block of every category.
  - They can be spread out across all of your pages.
  - If you can't find one in the category that does not require a premium account, skip the category.
- At least 1 hack block!
  - **Step 12:** this block should be styled not by WordPress, but by your own injected CSS.
  - Normally we need to get a premium account to add custom css, but there are sneaky ways around it.
- A contact form.
- A font chosen by you.
- A README on your repository linking to your website.
