## Me B-DAY mission
***

- [x] Go to the WordPress official website and register.
- [x] Click on the "start your website" button
- [x] Choose a domain name for your website, then select the free option
- [x] Don't worry, you don't have to pay. Click the obscurely hidden "start with a free site" link.
- Let's start building!
- [x] Choose a theme if you want to do this on easy mode, use a blank canvas if you want more of a challenge!
  - Some themes will have a blog-like homepage. The content on this page will be generated based on which posts you make.
  - This makes it pretty limited as to how we're able to customise our homepage.
  - This will also change some features in you UI, like the "edit" feature on your homepage.
  - You will be able to make changes to your homepage, but way more limited than on "regular" pages.
  - If you want to change your theme to a different one, click on "My Home" in the menu and next "Change theme".
- [x] There's a couple steps WordPress gives you in the "Site setup" menu, complete them.
  - Pay attention to their explanations, their tutorials help you understand how to interact with their UI
  - If you want to skip all tutorials, that's fine too, it should be manageable to understand.
  - If you skip the tutorials and things are not clear, you might want to revisit the tutorials.
- [x] When done following the steps, you can launch your website.
  - Again, you don't need to pay. Scroll to the bottom of the page for your free option.
  - While choosing the plan, you also do not need to pay.
- [x] Now make a repository, add a README and put the link to your website in there.
- [x] Let's have a look at our pages, click on the "Pages" tab in the menu
  - You now get an overview of your Published, Drafted, Scheduled and Trashed pages.
  - Remove all unwanted pages, only regular pages can be trashed, so make the ones you want to trash all regular pages.
  - Add at least one page, you can choose a theme again or use a blank page!
  - This takes you to the page editor of WordPress.
  - Save this draft for now.
- [x] A couple of things to know about this edit view:
  - If you want to go back to the home view, the top left WordPress logo is the place to go. Click "view pages" and you're back where you were.
  - You can click on any element in the page and edit it directly
  - The plus button in the toolbar opens up the block inserter, this is to add new elements to your page.
  - If you want a nice overview of all elements on your page, click on the list view in the toolbar
  - To the right of the toolbar, you can open up the settings. These show you the settings of the page you're on or the block you select.
  - Next to the settings you can change the fonts and global styles
  - The button with the 3 dots is the option button. Right now you can see we are in the visual editor, but if you want to write code you can also open the code editor.
- [x] Let's add some things! Open up the block inserter
  - You can see a lot of categories, each containing elements you can add to your page
  - From each category, pick at least 1 of the blocks to add to this page, or any other page you make. (Except for the earn category)
  - If you can't find one in the category that does not require a premium account, skip the category.
  - Make sure to customise every block, you can use dummy / fake text but don't leave anything empty that shouldn't be.
- [x] Let's get hacky! Open up the code editor
  - In the code, add a div and put some text in it at the top.
  - Above that, add a style tag and customise the div to have a background color.
  - WordPress doesn't like you doing that, so some wonky stuff might happen
  - There is a way to overcome this, the end result will be your div with a background color
- [x] Let's customise our theme! Go back to the home view of your website and click on "appearance" in the left toolbar
  - Now we can customise our selected theme or change it! Go ahead and click on "customise"
  - In here we can change stuff like colors, menus and so on.
  - Adding additional css is a premium feature, however in the previous step we have learned to overcome this with our developer knowledge! Nice try WordPress!
  - WordPress does their best though to make our life a living hell when we try to change something through css, so not everything will work.
- [x] Remember how to customise your fonts? Go ahead and pick one to your liking, don't leave it at the default font!
- [x] Last step, add a contact form anywhere on your pages.
- [x] Done! Go have a look at the nice to have features, or just have some fun with WordPress!

## B-DAY Must-haves
***

- At least 2 pages.
  - Both have a custom background color, not the original one! (It can be the same color on both pages).
  - Change the footer credit. Optionally try hiding it anyway!
- At least 1 block of every category.
  - They can be spread out across all of your pages.
  - If you can't find one in the category that does not require a premium account, skip the category.
- At least 1 hack block!
  - **Step 12:** this block should be styled not by WordPress, but by your own injected CSS.
  - Normally we need to get a premium account to add custom css, but there are sneaky ways around it.
- A contact form.
- A font chosen by you.
- A README on your repository linking to your website.

## B-DAY I-wish-to-haves features
***

- A finished product for a friend.
- A **Theme** you made from scratch.
- Can you add JavaScript to your project?

## What did I learn

I learned that WordPress is great for people who don't know how to code. Its interface can be useful for people who like making sites this way.
For me personally it was hell. It didn't feel natural at all and was frustrating at times. I did see there are lots of possibilities, and they provide you with lots of plugins.


## What I think about WordPress

Well it made me dislike WordPress. The editor got stuck a few times in my case, it was slow at times. I looked quite a while on how to link my pages.
But eventually I managed to figure it out. I do have to say that after a while once you get used to the interface, it got easier.
Still I didn't really like it, I would rather make a website using my IDE and some good old coding.
I think from the possibilities out there, because I had to make a site with WIX once *ugh shivers*, it is probably one of the best at least if I compare it to Wix.

I also managed to add some css, I had to do it with some inline styling (which I don't like). I just kept it simple because when I opened the editor I thought *sheesh* what is this monstrosity.
